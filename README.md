## Work in Progress

Tuneo is currently under active development. We're building something different in the music streaming space, and we're excited to share our vision.

## What is Tuneo?

Tuneo addresses two fundamental problems with modern music streaming: compromised audio quality and discovery algorithms that trap you in a bubble. We're building a platform that delivers both audiophile-grade sound and genuinely intelligent music discovery.

## Core Features

### Ultra-High-Fidelity Streaming

Music deserves to be heard exactly as the artist intended. No compromises.

- **Lossless Audio Quality** - Studio-grade FLAC and ALAC streaming up to 24-bit/192kHz
- **Bit-Perfect Playback** - True high-fidelity that matches or exceeds Tidal and Qobuz standards
- **Zero Buffering** - Engineered for instant playback and seamless listening
- **Adaptive Quality** - Intelligent streaming that adjusts to your connection without sacrificing fidelity
- **Hi-Res Format Support** - Full compatibility with MQA and other premium audio formats

### Intelligent Music Discovery

Stop getting the same recommendations as everyone else. Our discovery engine understands your unique taste and introduces you to artists you'll actually love.

- **Deep Taste Understanding** - Advanced analysis that goes far beyond simple genre matching
- **Niche Artist Discovery** - Uncover hidden gems like Cuarteto de Nos, Rupatrupa, and countless artists you never knew existed
- **Context-Aware Recommendations** - Suggestions tailored to your mood, time of day, and current activity
- **Anti-Mainstream Algorithm** - Specifically designed to break you out of filter bubbles
- **Global Listening Networks** - Learn from listeners with similar taste profiles around the world
- **Evolving Playlists** - Recommendations that grow and adapt as your taste develops

### Revolutionary Audio Recognition

The most advanced audio identification technology ever built for music lovers.

- **Instant Recognition** - Identify any track in under one second with exceptional accuracy
- **Hummed Melody Search** - Can't remember the name? Just hum the tune and we'll find it
- **Noisy Environment Detection** - Recognize music even in crowded cafes, parties, or on the street
- **Live Performance Matching** - Works with live recordings, covers, and acoustic versions
- **Multiple Track Detection** - Identify several songs playing at the same time
- **Offline Recognition** - Full functionality even without an internet connection

## Why Tuneo is Different

Current streaming services force you to choose: either you get high-quality audio with basic recommendations, or you get smart algorithms with compressed audio. Tuneo refuses to make that compromise.

We're combining three breakthrough technologies to create something entirely new. The result is a platform that respects the art, celebrates musical diversity, and makes discovery effortless.

**For Audiophiles** - We deliver the pristine audio quality you demand without the limitations of current hi-fi services.

**For Music Explorers** - Our discovery engine is built to expand your horizons, not reinforce what you already know.

**For Everyone** - Whether you're trying to identify a song you heard in passing or find your next obsession, Tuneo makes it simple.

## Development Status

Tuneo is in active development. We're currently building:

- Core streaming infrastructure for high-fidelity playback
- Audio fingerprinting and recognition engine
- Machine learning models for taste analysis and recommendations
- Cross-platform applications for web, mobile, and desktop

This is a significant undertaking, and we're committed to getting it right. We're not rushing to launch a half-finished product. When Tuneo is ready, it will represent a genuine leap forward in music streaming.

## The Vision

Music streaming has stagnated. Services compete on catalog size and price, but the fundamental experience hasn't evolved in years. Tuneo is our answer to that stagnation.

We believe music lovers deserve better. Better sound quality. Better discovery. Better technology. That's what we're building.
